This repository is my personal lab for practicing Python by building step-by-step projects.
Each folder contains a self-contained project that I followed from a tutorial, with my own notes, improvements, and experiments. 

## Goals
- Reinforce Python fundamentals through hands-on projects.
- Explore popular libraries and frameworks.
